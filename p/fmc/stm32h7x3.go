// Package fmc provides access to the registers of the FMC peripheral.
//
// Instances:
//  FMC  FMC_BASE  AHB3  FMC
// Registers:
//  0x000 32  BCT{CR,TR}[4]  chip-select control and timing registers
//  0x080 32  PCR            NAND Flash control registers
//  0x084 32  SR             This register contains information about the FIFO status and interrupt. The FMC features a FIFO that is used when writing to memories to transfer up to 16 words of data.This is used to quickly write to the FIFO and free the AXI bus for transactions to peripherals other than the FMC, while the FMC is draining its FIFO into the memory. One of these register bits indicates the status of the FIFO, for ECC purposes.The ECC is calculated while the data are written to the memory. To read the correct ECC, the software must consequently wait until the FIFO is empty.
//  0x088 32  PMEM           The FMC_PMEM read/write register contains the timing information for NAND Flash memory bank. This information is used to access either the common memory space of the NAND Flash for command, address write access and data read/write access.
//  0x08C 32  PATT           The FMC_PATT read/write register contains the timing information for NAND Flash memory bank. It is used for 8-bit accesses to the attribute memory space of the NAND Flash for the last address write access if the timing must differ from that of previous accesses (for Ready/Busy management, refer to Section20.8.5: NAND Flash prewait feature).
//  0x094 32  ECCR           This register contain the current error correction code value computed by the ECC computation modules of the FMC NAND controller. When the CPU reads/writes the data from a NAND Flash memory page at the correct address (refer to Section20.8.6: Computation of the error correction code (ECC) in NAND Flash memory), the data read/written from/to the NAND Flash memory are processed automatically by the ECC computation module. When X bytes have been read (according to the ECCPS field in the FMC_PCR registers), the CPU must read the computed ECC value from the FMC_ECC registers. It then verifies if these computed parity data are the same as the parity value recorded in the spare area, to determine whether a page is valid, and, to correct it otherwise. The FMC_ECCR register should be cleared after being read by setting the ECCEN bit to 0. To compute a new data block, the ECCEN bit must be set to 1.
//  0x104 32  BWTR[4]        write timing registers
//  0x140 32  SDCR1          This register contains the control parameters for each SDRAM memory bank
//  0x144 32  SDCR2          This register contains the control parameters for each SDRAM memory bank
//  0x148 32  SDTR1          This register contains the timing parameters of each SDRAM bank
//  0x14C 32  SDTR2          This register contains the timing parameters of each SDRAM bank
//  0x150 32  SDCMR          This register contains the command issued when the SDRAM device is accessed. This register is used to initialize the SDRAM device, and to activate the Self-refresh and the Power-down modes. As soon as the MODE field is written, the command will be issued only to one or to both SDRAM banks according to CTB1 and CTB2 command bits. This register is the same for both SDRAM banks.
//  0x154 32  SDRTR          This register sets the refresh rate in number of SDCLK clock cycles between the refresh cycles by configuring the Refresh Timer Count value.Examplewhere 64 ms is the SDRAM refresh period.The refresh rate must be increased by 20 SDRAM clock cycles (as in the above example) to obtain a safe margin if an internal refresh request occurs when a read request has been accepted. It corresponds to a COUNT value of 0000111000000 (448). This 13-bit field is loaded into a timer which is decremented using the SDRAM clock. This timer generates a refresh pulse when zero is reached. The COUNT value must be set at least to 41 SDRAM clock cycles.As soon as the FMC_SDRTR register is programmed, the timer starts counting. If the value programmed in the register is 0, no refresh is carried out. This register must not be reprogrammed after the initialization procedure to avoid modifying the refresh rate.Each time a refresh pulse is generated, this 13-bit COUNT field is reloaded into the counter.If a memory access is in progress, the Auto-refresh request is delayed. However, if the memory access and Auto-refresh requests are generated simultaneously, the Auto-refresh takes precedence. If the memory access occurs during a refresh operation, the request is buffered to be processed when the refresh is complete.This register is common to SDRAM bank 1 and bank 2.

	MBKEN     CR = 0x01 << 0  //+ Memory bank enable bit This bit enables the memory bank. After reset Bank1 is enabled, all others are disabled. Accessing a disabled bank causes an ERROR on AXI bus.
	MUXEN     CR = 0x01 << 1  //+ Address/data multiplexing enable bit When this bit is set, the address and data values are multiplexed on the data bus, valid only with NOR and PSRAM memories:
	MTYP      CR = 0x03 << 2  //+ Memory type These bits define the type of external memory attached to the corresponding memory bank:
	MWID      CR = 0x03 << 4  //+ Memory data bus width Defines the external memory device width, valid for all type of memories.

	BURSTEN   CR = 0x01 << 8  //+ Burst enable bit This bit enables/disables synchronous accesses during read operations. It is valid only for synchronous memories operating in Burst mode:
	WAITPOL   CR = 0x01 << 9  //+ Wait signal polarity bit This bit defines the polarity of the wait signal from memory used for either in synchronous or asynchronous mode:
	WAITCFG   CR = 0x01 << 11 //+ Wait timing configuration The NWAIT signal indicates whether the data from the memory are valid or if a wait state must be inserted when accessing the memory in synchronous mode. This configuration bit determines if NWAIT is asserted by the memory one clock cycle before the wait state or during the wait state:
	WREN      CR = 0x01 << 12 //+ Write enable bit This bit indicates whether write operations are enabled/disabled in the bank by the FMC:
	WAITEN    CR = 0x01 << 13 //+ Wait enable bit This bit enables/disables wait-state insertion via the NWAIT signal when accessing the memory in synchronous mode.
	EXTMOD    CR = 0x01 << 14 //+ Extended mode enable. This bit enables the FMC to program the write timings for asynchronous accesses inside the FMC_BWTR register, thus resulting in different timings for read and write operations. Note: When the extended mode is disabled, the FMC can operate in Mode1 or Mode2 as follows: ** Mode 1 is the default mode when the SRAM/PSRAM memory type is selected (MTYP =0x0 or 0x01) ** Mode 2 is the default mode when the NOR memory type is selected (MTYP = 0x10).
	ASYNCWAIT CR = 0x01 << 15 //+ Wait signal during asynchronous transfers This bit enables/disables the FMC to use the wait signal even during an asynchronous protocol.
	CPSIZE    CR = 0x07 << 16 //+ CRAM Page Size These are used for Cellular RAM 1.5 which does not allow burst access to cross the address boundaries between pages. When these bits are configured, the FMC controller splits automatically the burst access when the memory page size is reached (refer to memory datasheet for page size). Other configuration: reserved.
	CBURSTRW  CR = 0x01 << 19 //+ Write burst enable For PSRAM (CRAM) operating in Burst mode, the bit enables synchronous accesses during write operations. The enable bit for synchronous read accesses is the BURSTEN bit in the FMC_BCRx register.

It is only enabled through the FMC_BCR1 register. Bank 1 must be configured in synchronous mode to generate the FMC_CLK continuous clock. If CCLKEN bit is set, the FMC_CLK clock ratio is specified by CLKDIV value in the FMC_BTR1 register. CLKDIV in FMC_BWTR1 is dont care. If the synchronous mode is used and CCLKEN bit is set, the synchronous memories connected to other banks than Bank 1 are clocked by the same clock (the CLKDIV value in the FMC_BTR2..4 and FMC_BWTR2..4 registers for other banks has no effect.)
	WFDIS     CR = 0x01 << 21 //+ Write FIFO Disable This bit disables the Write FIFO used by the FMC controller. Note: The WFDIS bit of the FMC_BCR2..4 registers is dont care. It is only enabled through the FMC_BCR1 register.

	BUSTURN TR = 0x0F << 16 //+ Bus turnaround phase duration These bits are written by software to add a delay at the end of a write-to-read or read-to write transaction. The programmed bus turnaround delay is inserted between an asynchronous read (in muxed or mode D) or write transaction and any other asynchronous /synchronous read/write from/to a static bank. If a read operation is performed, the bank can be the same or a different one, whereas it must be different in case of write operation to the bank, except in muxed mode or mode D. In some cases, whatever the programmed BUSTRUN values, the bus turnaround delay is fixed as follows: The bus turnaround delay is not inserted between two consecutive asynchronous write transfers to the same static memory bank except in muxed mode and mode D. There is a bus turnaround delay of 1 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive asynchronous read transfers to the same static memory bank except for modes muxed and D. An asynchronous read to an asynchronous or synchronous write to any static bank or dynamic bank except in modes muxed and D mode. There is a bus turnaround delay of 2 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive synchronous write operations (in Burst or Single mode) to the same bank. A synchronous write (burst or single) access and an asynchronous write or read transfer to or from static memory bank (the bank can be the same or a different one in case of a read operation. Two consecutive synchronous read operations (in Burst or Single mode) followed by any synchronous/asynchronous read or write from/to another static memory bank. There is a bus turnaround delay of 3 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive synchronous write operations (in Burst or Single mode) to different static banks. A synchronous write access (in Burst or Single mode) and a synchronous read from the same or a different bank. The bus turnaround delay allows to match the minimum time between consecutive transactions (tEHEL from NEx high to NEx low) and the maximum time required by the memory to free the data bus after a read access (tEHQZ): (BUSTRUN + 1) KCK_FMC period &#8805; tEHELmin and (BUSTRUN + 2)KCK_FMC period &#8805; tEHQZmax if EXTMOD = 0 (BUSTRUN + 2)KCK_FMC period &#8805; max (tEHELmin, tEHQZmax) if EXTMOD = 126. ...
