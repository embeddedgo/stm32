	EN        CR = 0x01 << 0  //+ Enable Enable the QUADSPI.
	ABORT     CR = 0x01 << 1  //+ Abort request This bit aborts the on-going command sequence. It is automatically reset once the abort is complete. This bit stops the current transfer. In polling mode or memory-mapped mode, this bit also reset the APM bit or the DM bit.
	DMAEN     CR = 0x01 << 2  //+ DMA enable In indirect mode, DMA can be used to input or output data via the QUADSPI_DR register. DMA transfers are initiated when the FIFO threshold flag, FTF, is set.
	TCEN      CR = 0x01 << 3  //+ Timeout counter enable This bit is valid only when memory-mapped mode (FMODE = 11) is selected. Activating this bit causes the chip select (nCS) to be released (and thus reduces consumption) if there has not been an access after a certain amount of time, where this time is defined by TIMEOUT[15:0] (QUADSPI_LPTR). Enable the timeout counter. By default, the QUADSPI never stops its prefetch operation, keeping the previous read operation active with nCS maintained low, even if no access to the Flash memory occurs for a long time. Since Flash memories tend to consume more when nCS is held low, the application might want to activate the timeout counter (TCEN = 1, QUADSPI_CR[3]) so that nCS is released after a period of TIMEOUT[15:0] (QUADSPI_LPTR) cycles have elapsed without an access since when the FIFO becomes full with prefetch data. This bit can be modified only when BUSY = 0.
	SSHIFT    CR = 0x01 << 4  //+ Sample shift By default, the QUADSPI samples data 1/2 of a CLK cycle after the data is driven by the Flash memory. This bit allows the data is to be sampled later in order to account for external signal delays. Firmware must assure that SSHIFT = 0 when in DDR mode (when DDRM = 1). This field can be modified only when BUSY = 0.
	DFM       CR = 0x01 << 6  //+ Dual-flash mode This bit activates dual-flash mode, where two external Flash memories are used simultaneously to double throughput and capacity. This bit can be modified only when BUSY = 0.
	FSEL      CR = 0x01 << 7  //+ Flash memory selection This bit selects the Flash memory to be addressed in single flash mode (when DFM = 0). This bit can be modified only when BUSY = 0. This bit is ignored when DFM = 1.
	FTHRES    CR = 0x1F << 8  //+ FIFO threshold level Defines, in indirect mode, the threshold number of bytes in the FIFO that will cause the FIFO threshold flag (FTF, QUADSPI_SR[2]) to be set. In indirect write mode (FMODE = 00): ... In indirect read mode (FMODE = 01): ... If DMAEN = 1, then the DMA controller for the corresponding channel must be disabled before changing the FTHRES value.
	TEIE      CR = 0x01 << 16 //+ Transfer error interrupt enable This bit enables the transfer error interrupt.
	TCIE      CR = 0x01 << 17 //+ Transfer complete interrupt enable This bit enables the transfer complete interrupt.
	FTIE      CR = 0x01 << 18 //+ FIFO threshold interrupt enable This bit enables the FIFO threshold interrupt.
	SMIE      CR = 0x01 << 19 //+ Status match interrupt enable This bit enables the status match interrupt.
	TOIE      CR = 0x01 << 20 //+ TimeOut interrupt enable This bit enables the TimeOut interrupt.
	APMS      CR = 0x01 << 22 //+ Automatic poll mode stop This bit determines if automatic polling is stopped after a match. This bit can be modified only when BUSY = 0.
	PMM       CR = 0x01 << 23 //+ Polling match mode This bit indicates which method should be used for determining a match during automatic polling mode. This bit can be modified only when BUSY = 0.
	PRESCALER CR = 0xFF << 24 //+ clock prescaler

	FSIZE  DCR = 0x1F << 16 //+ Flash memory size This field defines the size of external memory using the following formula: Number of bytes in Flash memory = 2[FSIZE+1] FSIZE+1 is effectively the number of address bits required to address the Flash memory. The Flash memory capacity can be up to 4GB (addressed using 32 bits) in indirect mode, but the addressable space in memory-mapped mode is limited to 256MB. If DFM = 1, FSIZE indicates the total capacity of the two Flash memories together. This field can be modified only when BUSY = 0.

A value no greater than 3 (indicating 4 bytes) should be used for status-polling mode. All 1s in indirect mode means undefined length, where QUADSPI will continue until the end of memory, as defined by FSIZE. 0x0000_0000: 1 byte is to be transferred 0x0000_0001: 2 bytes are to be transferred 0x0000_0002: 3 bytes are to be transferred 0x0000_0003: 4 bytes are to be transferred ... 0xFFFF_FFFD: 4,294,967,294 (4G-2) bytes are to be transferred 0xFFFF_FFFE: 4,294,967,295 (4G-1) bytes are to be transferred 0xFFFF_FFFF: undefined length -- all bytes until the end of Flash memory (as defined by FSIZE) are to be transferred. Continue reading indefinitely if FSIZE = 0x1F. DL[0] is stuck at 1 in dual-flash mode (DFM = 1) even when 0 is written to this bit, thus assuring that each access transfers an even number of bytes.

In indirect write mode, data written to this register is stored on the FIFO before it is sent to the Flash memory during the data phase. If the FIFO is too full, a write operation is stalled until the FIFO has enough space to accept the amount of data being written. In indirect read mode, reading this register gives (via the FIFO) the data which was received from the Flash memory. If the FIFO does not have as many bytes as requested by the read operation and if BUSY=1, the read operation is stalled until enough data is present or until the transfer is complete, whichever happens first. In automatic polling mode, this register contains the last data read from the Flash memory (without masking). Word, halfword, and byte accesses to this register are supported. In indirect write mode, a byte write adds 1 byte to the FIFO, a halfword write 2, and a word write 4. Similarly, in indirect read mode, a byte read removes 1 byte from the FIFO, a halfword read 2, and a word read 4. Accesses in indirect mode must be aligned to the bottom of this register: a byte read must read DATA[7:0] and a halfword read must read DATA[15:0].
