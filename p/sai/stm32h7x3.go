The minimum number of bits to transfer in an audio frame must be equal to 8, otherwise the audio block will behaves in an unexpected way. This is the case when the data size is 8 bits and only one slot 0 is defined in NBSLOT[4:0] of SAI_xSLOTR register (NBSLOT[3:0] = 0000). In master mode, if the master clock (available on MCLK_x pin) is used, the frame length should be aligned with a number equal to a power of 2, ranging from 8 to 256. When the master clock is not used (NODIV = 1), it is recommended to program the frame length to an value ranging from 8 to 256.

The value set in this bitfield represents the number of slots + 1 in the audio frame (including the number of inactive slots). The maximum number of slots is 16.

When this bit is set, an interrupt is generated if the FREQ bit in the SAI_xSR register is set.

This bit is meaningful only when the audio block operates as a transmitter, the number of slots is lower or equal to 2 and the MUTE bit is set. If more slots are declared, the bit value sent during the transmission in mute mode is equal to 0, whatever the value of MUTEVAL. if the number of slot is lower or equal to 2 and MUTEVAL = 1, the MUTE value transmitted for each slot is the one sent during the previous frame. Refer to Section: Mute mode for more details. Note: This bit is meaningless and should not be used for SPDIF audio blocks.
	MUTECNT SAI_BCR2 = 0x3F << 7  //+ Mute counter. These bits are set and cleared by software. They are used only in reception mode. The value set in these bits is compared to the number of consecutive mute frames detected in reception. When the number of mute frames is equal to this value, the flag MUTEDET will be set and an interrupt will be generated if bit MUTEDETIE is set. Refer to Section: Mute mode for more details.

The -Law and the A-Law log are a part of the CCITT G.711 recommendation, the type of complement that will be used depends on CPL bit. The data expansion or data compression are determined by the state of bit MODE[0]. The data compression is applied if the audio block is configured as a transmitter. The data expansion is automatically applied when the audio block is configured as a receiver. Refer to Section: Companding mode for more details. Note: Companding mode is applicable only when TDM is selected.
